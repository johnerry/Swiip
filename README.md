## Inspiration
Being from Nigeria is inspiration enough to do something about the rising increase of the already plagued polluted land and water. There is just no responsibility by either the Government or its people to protect the environment against pollution and the inevitable adverse global warming. I feel its time to make a change and we can only do this if we come together to make a difference. I believe there are people out there like me who wants to make a change, and are financially ok to make these changes, but can't possibly do it alone or has no platform to do these things. And here is where SWIIP can come in. A quick easy interface that allows for crowd funding to clean our society as well as payment for ones personal waste pickup by authorized agents who can maintain these waste will go a long way into improving our society.


## What it does
This app simple allows an admin to post list of certain effected society and members who join in or willing to join in can simply raise funds till its enough to clean the affected society. They see a change in funds percentage immediately they make payment, hence they know they are, along with other people are walking towards a goal. They can also order for their personal waste pickup as well.

If you are going to clone this repo to your local machine, make sure you apply for your own google map api key.
The interface is simply straight forward and there will be no issues on navigation.

## Setup

Install `npm` or `yarn` if you dont have any of them already installed.
After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` or `npm install` to get started by installing dependencies. 

`src/index.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

All tests should be written in the `__tests__' folder. There's a sample in there.

This starter uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) as the bundler. It is much simpler that WebPack and the others

#### Hints

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.
- Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`
- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
- Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.
